# React Todo App

This is a simple todo list app built using React and Redux, this web app allows to create a list of to-dos with custom categories.
In the drag and drop aspect the app uses [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd), a Dnd library.

The app is adapted for large screen size as well as for mobile screen size.
The to-dos are saved to local storage. You can leave the site at anytime, then back in and your to-dos will still be there!
